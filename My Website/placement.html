<h1> Placements in SLIET</h1>
<p>Most companies that come are IT companies. The placement record was low because the quality of students was below average. They could not even qualify the written exams for interviews, until the college started taking admission through JEE Mains.

The companies that have visited the campus are TCS, NEC Technologies, Godrej, Honda Cars, ISGEC Yamuna Nagar, Eclerex, HP, Pagro Foods, Kandhari Beverages, Eastman Impex Group, PepsiCo, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle etc.
 The students were offered jobs in almost every field ranging from marketing and sales to core engineering.
</p>
<p>From 2007 to 2012, the college had excellent placement record. Then it fell in year from 2013 to 2016 and now in 2017 batch my seniors had got nice placement. Approx 75-80% students has placed. Now, it is our turn and it will be better than last batch. Then students get admission in IITs, IISc and IIMs also. Alumni support always for industrial visit or training and also in placement.
